c++:
-->C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.
-->The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not support.

#include<iostream> is header file library that lets us work with input and output objects

'using namespace std' means we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.

*Omitting Namespace: using "std::"

#include<iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout<<"hello-world";
  return 0;
}

note:
-->The newline character (\n) is called an escape sequence.
-->using two \n\n it will gets one line gap
-->can use "endl" instead of \n
-->Both \n and endl are used to break lines. However, \n is most used.
-->\t	Creates a horizontal tab

NOTE:
--> + is used for addition of two numbers.
--> + is also used for string concatenation.
--> length() or size() will gets the same output.

-->To access the strings use concept of index in it.

strings:
1.concatenation
2.append()
3.length() or size()
4.accessing the strings using index concept
5.changing the string characters using index
6.getline(cin,name) //prints entire name..

eg: I entered the fullname as sandeep adari but here prints only sandeep and adari is missing.
-->To overcome this problem use the function called getline();

**IMPORTANT MATH LIBRARIES**:
1.min
2.max
3.sqrt
4.log
5.round
6.floor -->rounded down to its nearest integer
7.ceil  -->rounded up to its nearest integer
8.pow
9.cbrt(cube root)

**Conditional Statements**:
1.if else,else if
2.switch -->break,default(no case is matched with variable given)

foreach:
when foreach is not working in devc++ please do these steps
Go to the "Tools" Option
Select "Compiler Options"
Click "Settings"
Click "Code Generation"
Go to "Choose Language" and select "ISO C++11"
